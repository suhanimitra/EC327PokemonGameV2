The WildPokemon will start following a trainer if they're in the same location.
This triggers the boolean member I added in the Trainer class, hasPokemon, to be true.
From then onwards, the Trainer's health gets decremented more intensely than before by the attack member of the WildPokemon.

I added some functions in order to fulfill the prior tasks and generally added comments to explain how they work.
